# QuickStart Guide for Setting up PwR-Studio ðŸŽ‰

## Prerequisites

1. **OpenAI or Azure OpenAI Keys:** Obtain from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) or [Azure](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. **Docker:** Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for Windows and Mac or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for Linux.
3. **Docker Compose:** Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for running multiple containers.
4. **Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) Keys:** Obtain from [Azure](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Instructions

1. **Start Docker:**
   - Ensure Docker Desktop is running.

2. **Open Bash Terminal:**
   - For Windows, use WSL2.

You need to setup 3 repositories to start the PwR Studio. Follow the instructions below to clone the repositories. Keep the repositories in the same directory.

3. **Clone PwR-Studio Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:microsoft/PwR-Studio.git
   ```
   - **Note:** If you encounter the following error, your SSH setup is incorrect. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

     ```
     Permission denied (publickey).
     fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

     Please make sure you have the correct access rights
     and the repository exists.
     ```

4. **Clone [JB-Studio-Engine](https://github.com/OpenNyAI/Jugalbandi-Studio-Engine) Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:OpenNyAI/Jugalbandi-Studio-Engine.git
   ```


5. **Clone [PwR-NL2DSL](https://github.com/microsoft/PwR-NL2DSL) Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:microsoft/PwR-NL2DSL.git
   ```
Great job! You have successfully cloned the repositories. ðŸŽ‰

6. **Setup Local Environment Variables:**
   1. Copy `env-dev.template` to `.env-dev`:
      ```bash
      cp env-dev.template .env-dev
      ```
   2. Enter your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI credentials in the `.env-dev` file.
   3. Enter your MSAL Auth keys.
   - **Note:** Remove Azure keys if you are not using them.

## Steps to Start PwR Studio

We have script files to start the PwR Studio. You can use the following commands to start the PwR Studio.

1. **Start Postgres DB and Add Basic Data:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run.sh postgres
   ```
   Note: Keep the Postgres container running in the background. Until you run the next command, do not stop the Postgres container.

2. **Restore the Backup Data from PwR Studio and JB-Studio-Engine:**
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -h localhost < scripts/backup.sql
   ```
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -h localhost < ../JB-Studio-Engine/backup.sql
   ```
   - **Note:** This will prompt you to enter the password for the Postgres DB.
      ```Password for user postgres: ``` 
   - The default password is `postgres`. Enter the password and press Enter.

   This will restore the data from the backup file to the Postgres DB.

3. **Setup Kafka and Create a Topic:**
   1. First start a Kafka container using the following command:
      ```bash
      ./scripts/run.sh kafka
      ```
      Note: Keep the kafka container running in the background. Until you run the next command, do not stop the kafka container.

   2. Next, create a kafka topic `jb` using the following command:
      ```bash
      ./scripts/create-topic.sh jb
      ```

4. **Start the PwR Studio:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run.sh server studio engine
   ```
   - **Note:** You need to run the above command twice to start both the PwR Studio and the engine. First time, let the server start completely and then stop (`Ctrl + C`) it. Then run the command again to start the engine.

5. **Open PwR Studio in Browser:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:4173`

6. **Next Instructions to Test:**
   - Follow the specific testing instructions provided.
